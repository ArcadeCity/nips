Public Chat

`draft` `optional` `author:ChristopherDavid` `author:fiatjaf` `author:jb55`

This NIP defines new event kinds for public chat channels, channel messages, and basic client-side moderation.

It reserves new four event kinds (40-43) for immediate use and six event kinds (44-49) for future use.

- `40 - channel create`
- `41 - channel metadata`
- `42 - channel message`
- `43 - hide message`

### Kind 40: Create channel

In creation event, client SHOULD include basic channel metadata (`name`, `about`, `picture` as specified in kind 41).

Example event:

```
{
    content: '{"name": "Demo Channel", "about": "A test channel.", "picture": "https://placekitten.com/200/200"}',
    tags: ["e", <channel_create_event>]`,
    ...
}


### Kind 41: Set channel metadata

Clients and relays SHOULD handle kind 41 events similar to kind 0 `metadata` events.

Clients SHOULD support basic metadata fields:

- `name` - string - Channel name
- `about` - string - Channel description
- `picture` - string - URL of channel picture

Clients MAY add additional metadata fields.


### Kind 42: Create channel message

Example event:

```json
{
    content: <string>,
    tags: ["e", <channel_create_event>]`,
    ...
}
```

### Kind 43: Hide message





Future extensibility
--------------------

We reserve event kinds 44-49 for other events related to chat, to potentially include new types of media (photo/video), moderation, or support of private or group messaging.
